# nanoprocessor
This repository contains the VHDL design for a 4-bit nanoprocessor. The improved version uses a 100% logic gate design, optimized with Karnaugh-maps for speed and low power consumption. It includes an expanded instruction set, a carry-look-ahead adder, and a Python compiler to convert assembly into machine code.
